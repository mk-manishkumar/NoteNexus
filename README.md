# What I learnt from this project

Through this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and its usage in web development. Additionally, I acquired knowledge of local storage and its implementation in JavaScript. I also extensively worked with event listeners and learned their various applications. One of the significant skills I developed through this project was creating a hamburger menu using JavaScript. Moreover, I gained familiarity with several JavaScript methods such as location.reload(), remove(), target, and dataset, which enhanced my proficiency in the language.
